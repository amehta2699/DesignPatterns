# DesignPatterns

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template used to know how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that a programmer can use to solve common problems while designing an application or system.
